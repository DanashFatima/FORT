# FORT
The Foundational Ontological Relations Theory.
------------------------------------------------


## FORT-CL-ontology: 

* The ontology modules of FORT serialized in the CLIF dialect of the Common Logic standard. 
    
* The conversions to other dialects such as Prover9 and TPTP.
    
* The READMe file explains the followed procedure for the installation and usage of tha maceod tool.
    
## FORT-OWL-ontology: 

This folder contains the OWL serialization of the FORT ontology. For the moment, this is a lite formalization based on the direct implementation of the SROIQ TBox into OWL axioms.

However, an additional serialization that enhances the lite one, is under-progress.

Additionally, two useÃ¨cases are under study to show the relevance of FORT in applications.


## FORT-SROIQ-formalization: 
This folder presents the application of the generic and systematic translation procedure that we built to extract decidable SROIQ fragments from FOL theories. 

The procedure is applied to FORT for obtaining the SROIQ formalization from the initial FOL formalization.

The publication of the procedure: "https://hal.science/hal-04397668"


## macleod: 

The macleod tool is available at the following link "https://github.com/thahmann/macleod". 
    
In this folder, we provide the *modified* configuration files of the local macleod repositoy in the home directory. These are:
    
* logging.conf
    
* macleod_win.conf
    
    
## VirtualEnvironment: 

The python virtual environment created for the installation of the macleod tool. 
    
In this folder, we provide the modified python parser files of the installed macleod tool in the virtual environment. These are:
    
* `Lib>site-packages>macleod>scripts>parser.py`
    
* `Lib>site-packages>macleod>parsing>parser.py`
