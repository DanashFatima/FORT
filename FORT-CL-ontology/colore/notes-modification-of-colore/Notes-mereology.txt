For mereology; FILE COMPLETE

From colore > mereology repository; we used the following files:
cem_mereology = cm_mereology + em_mereology
	cm = sum_mereology + product_mereology
		sum_mereology = m_mereology + overlaps_definition + underlaps_definitions + axiom pa6 which is the sum entity
			m_mereology = the three basic axioms of P
		product_mereology = m_mereology + overlaps_definition + axiom pa7 which is the product entity
	em = m_mereology + overlaps_definition +  axiom Strong Supplementation Principle pa5 which also implies the weak supplementation axiom pa4
	
colore_mereology_definitions = m_mereology + properpart pd1 + overlaps pd3 + underlaps pd4 + disjoint + atomic part + sum entity + product entity + complement + gunky
	Note that: equal can be represented using the = sign, so pd2 is already inluded
	
======> Modification points:
	Removed: the "gunky" definition was causing timeout problems in the validation process, so we disgraded it!!!
	Missing: overcross pd5 /undercross pd6 /partial overlap pd7 / partial underlap pd8 / + proper-overlap pd9 
	added the missing axioms to mereology definitions file

Different mereological theories can be then generated by adding axioms, i.e. assumptions of composition and/or decomposition principles, to M to allow for finer
grained types of part-whole relations or/and permit intransitivity in some cases.
The principle of decomposition introduces the argument that if some y has a proper part x, then there should be a remainder because x is less than y. This can be added either
using weak supplementation Pa4 resulting Minimal Mereology MM, or strong supplementation Pa5 resulting in Extensional Mereology EM. Note that in EM, the theorems
Pt1 and Pt2 are implied upon the addition of the supplementation axioms, and therefore the theorem Pt3 [12]. The principle of composition introduces the argument tha
a mereological domain shall be closed under various operations. This done either via finitary operations, i.e. finitary sum Pa6 and finitary product Pa7, resulting in Closure
Mereology CM, or via unrestricted fusions Pa8 i.e. the fusion of all objects satisfying the first-order formula φ in which x is a free variable, resulting in General Mereology GM.
Similarly, the result of adding Pa6 and Pa7 to MM/EM yields in CMM/CEM i.e. Closure Minimal/Extensional Mereology. Moreover, to ensure the unicity of the entities
that are held by means of Pa6 (the sum entity) and Pa7 (the product entity) under the presence of extensionality, it is possible to add the axioms Pa9 and Pa10, respectively.
